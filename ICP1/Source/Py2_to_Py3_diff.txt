Question-1:
 There is a syntactical difference between python 2 and 3. Here are few of the things:
1. print “hey” function in python 2 is replaced as print(“hey”)
2. In python 2 the calculation rounds to a nearest whole number where as in python 3 it rounds to a exact integer. 
Example: 5/2 = 2 - python 2
	5/2 = 2.5 – python 3
3. In python 2 the strings are stored as ASCII by default, in python 3 the strings are stored as Unicode by default.
